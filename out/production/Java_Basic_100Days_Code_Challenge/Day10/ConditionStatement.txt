There are three types of control flow statement.
        They are -  Decision Statement (decide whether the code is working according to conditions or not)
                    Looping Statement (loop the codes as long as the condition is true)
                    Jump statements (decide whether to continue to run codes or stop the running codes, mainly used in looping statements)

    Decision Statement
                "if" statement
                        it works when a condition is true if it's false then it works nothing
                "if / else" statement
                        "if" statement works as above and "else" statement works when "if" and "else if" statements is false
                "if / else if / else"
                        "else if" works when "if" and "else" statements were false. but "else if" works first then "else" works last.
                switch
                        "cases" in "switch" will work until the compiler sees "break" keyword.
                        After "cases" conditions are not ture, the "default" will work.
