There are two data types in Java.
Primitive Data Type
     Primitive data types are prepared by OS to use in Programming.
     In java, primitive data types are used in JVM.
     Primitive data types have their own literals and their values can be directly used in source code.
     There are three types of primitive data types. They are  -
            Numeric Data Type
                    Numeric data type has two more categories.
                            Integers
                                    byte,shot,int and long are used as integers data type.
                            Floating-point
                                    float and double are used as floating-point data type.
            Character Data Type
                    char is used in character data type.
                    char can be turned into int.
            Boolean Data Type
                    boolean is used in boolean data type.
Reference Data Types
    Reference data types are objects' types.

In JVM, there are two main memories. They're stack memory and heap memory
In stack memory,
        All codes that are currently running are copied into stack memory and cpu uses them.
        After executing the codes, stack memory clears them.
        Stack memory uses queueing system. (Last In, First Out)
        Stack memory uses primitive data types.
In heap memory,
        Compared to stack memory, heap memory has larger space and longer lifetime.
        Heap memory uses reference data types.
