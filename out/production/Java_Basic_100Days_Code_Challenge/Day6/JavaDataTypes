There are two data types in Java.
Primitive Data Type
     Primitive data types are prepared by OS to use in JVM.
Reference Data Types
    Reference data types are objects' types.

In JVM, there are two main memories. They're stack memory and heap memory
In stack memory,
        All codes that are currently running are copied into stack memory and cpu uses them.
        After executing the codes, stack memory clears them.
        Stack memory uses queueing system. (Last In, First Out)
In heap memory,
        Compared to stack memory, heap memory has larger space and longer lifetime.
