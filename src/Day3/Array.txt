#Array_Object
In java, array is an object.
array keeps elements(data) into its corresponding spaces(rooms).
To creat array(object), you need to set the number of space(room) before.
You can use the following styles to create an array,
        int array [] = {1,2,3} **You can only write this style while declaring variables. You can't assign any new variables to this array.**
        array = int [] {1,2,3,4}
        int [] array = new int []{1,2,3,4}
        int [] array = new int [3]

#Array_Initialization

In array, Index starts with 0.
If you add elements(data) directly to the array instead of setting  room's number in the array list, you can't set room's number while declaring the array.
In reverse, you can't add elements(data) to the array that has limited space number while  declaring the array.

int [] array = new int [] {1,2,3,4}
int [] array;
array = new int [4];
array[0] = 1; // In this line , 0 is the index and 1 is the value in that index array. You can use this way to assign value into array.
System.out.print(array[0]); //You can use this to show your 0th indexed array's value.
array[1] = 2;
array[2] = 3;
array[3] = 4;

New array space(room) can't be added or remove to the existing(declared) array.
You can assign the new values to the array's values one by one.
