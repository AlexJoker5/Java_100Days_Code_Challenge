Non Access Modifiers
    Common ones -   abstract, (will be talked more detail in OOP)
                    static (used in variables and methods) and
                    final.  (used in class means this class can't be extended,
                            used in variable means you can't change its value ,and it becomes constant.
                            used in method means you can't override this method.)
                    (**Note : You can't use final and abstract together.)
    Uncommon ones - synchronized, (used in methods, code blocks and used for multi-threading.)
                    volatile, (used in variables (mainly in primitive data types) and used for thread safe problem.)
                    native, (used in method)
                    strictfp and (used in class, interface and method)
                    transient. * (used in instance variables)
