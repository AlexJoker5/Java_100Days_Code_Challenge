There are 4 kinds of operators in java.
They are -
    Assignment Operators

            Assignment operator is used to assign variables and
            can be only used in primitive data type which can be turned into numeric data types.

    Arithmetic Operators

            Arithmetic operator is mostly used for calculating primitive variables.
            String can only use + sign operator.
            ++i is prefix. So, value is returned immediately after the calculation.
            i++ is postfix. So, value is not returned immediately after the calculation.
            variable's value is only change after you call that variable.

    Relational Operators

            Relational operators can be used in comparing primitive data types and return boolean value.

    Logical Operators

            Logical operators are used in primitive data types.
                !   not                 Urinary Operators       (common)
                &   and                 Binary Operators
                &&  short circuit and    Binary Operators       (common)
                |   or                  Binary Operators
                ||  short circuit or     Binary Operators       (common)
                ^   XOR {Exclusive Or}  Binary Operators
