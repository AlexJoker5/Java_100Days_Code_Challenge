# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I learn how to write class in java, how to comment, what is variable, what is code block, how to differentiate global variables and local variables, what are the differences between instance and static variables, how to create an object.

**Thoughts:** I have now known differences instance and static variables and how to use them correctly.

### Day 2: June 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learn how to write a proper method, what are static and instance methods, what is return type, what are differences between static and instance methods, how to avoid "ambiguous" error while writing methods with same method signatures, how to use other class's members in your class. 

**Thoughts:** Today biggest harvest is that I know properly static and instance. The most difficult one to remember for today is avoiding ambiguous since it's rarely used.
