# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I learn how to write class in java, how to comment, what is variable, what is code block, how to differentiate global variables and local variables, what are the differences between instance and static variables, how to create an object.

**Thoughts:** I have now known differences instance and static variables and how to use them correctly.

### Day 2: June 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learn how to write a proper method, what are static and instance methods, what is return type, what are differences between static and instance methods, how to avoid "ambiguous" error while writing methods with same method signatures, how to use other class's members in your class. 

**Thoughts:** Today biggest harvest is that I know properly static and instance. The most difficult one to remember for today is avoiding ambiguous since it's rarely used.

### Day 3: June 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I accidentally skipped course schedule and learn upcoming courses about array. Since I'm familiar with array, it wasn't so difficult. I learn what is an array, how to write array correctly, how to assign variables to an array, how to initialize array, what is multidimensional array and how to use methods in Arrays (built-in function of java).

**Thoughts:** Today biggest challenge is creating a method to add new values into the existing array by using Arrays.copyOf() method. I was struggling for an hour ,but eventually I get it.

### Day 4: June 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I learn what is constructor, how to write constructor and why I need constructor, what is default constructor, what is block, when to use static, instance and local blocks, and what are loading times of blocks and constructor.

**Thoughts:** There's a use about exception and FileInputStream in project which I'm not familiar.

### Day 5: June 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I learn what is package, what are access modifiers, where are access modifiers used, what are non-access modifiers, where are non-access modifiers used, what are identifiers and how to name them correctly.  

**Thoughts:** I skipped a day due to my Japanese study session. This should be day 6 ,but I just want to count the days I learn upto 100. Now, I have known access modifiers and non-access modifiers clearly.

### Day 6: June 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I learn what are data types, how does stack memory and reference memory works(not in details), what are primitive data types and which ones can be used as literal. 

**Thoughts:** I'm quite sleepy and distract my thoughts frequently ,and it's quite challenging to learn java today.

### Day 7: June 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I learn what is primitive casting, what is reference data type, how does jvm work and how does garbage collection work.

**Thoughts:** I really don't understand well and can't get into it since it's saying how memory works when we write class and objects.

### Day 8: June 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learn What and how multi-references work, how does static variable and instance variable passes in a static method, What is the difference between Primitive and References and What are primitive wrappers and wrapper classes.

**Thoughts:** I start studying later than the usual time. Today biggest harvest is I clearly understand differences between primitive and references and how does a static method's arguments work depending on variable types.
