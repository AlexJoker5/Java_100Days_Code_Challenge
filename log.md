# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I learn how to write class in java, how to comment, what is variable, what is code block, how to differentiate global variables and local variables, what are the differences between instance and static variables, how to create an object.

**Thoughts:** I have now known differences instance and static variables and how to use them correctly.

### Day 2: June 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learn how to write a proper method, what are static and instance methods, what is return type, what are differences between static and instance methods, how to avoid "ambiguous" error while writing methods with same method signatures, how to use other class's members in your class. 

**Thoughts:** Today biggest harvest is that I know properly static and instance. The most difficult one to remember for today is avoiding ambiguous since it's rarely used.

### Day 3: June 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I accidentally skipped course schedule and learn upcoming courses about array. Since I'm familiar with array, it wasn't so difficult. I learn what is an array, how to write array correctly, how to assign variables to an array, how to initialize array, what is multidimensional array and how to use methods in Arrays (built-in function of java).

**Thoughts:** Today biggest challenge is creating a method to add new values into the existing array by using Arrays.copyOf() method. I was struggling for an hour ,but eventually I get it.

### Day 4: June 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I learn what is constructor, how to write constructor and why I need constructor, what is default constructor, what is block, when to use static, instance and local blocks, and what are loading times of blocks and constructor.

**Thoughts:** There's a use about exception and FileInputStream in project which I'm not familiar.

### Day 5: June 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I learn what is package, what are access modifiers, where are access modifiers used, what are non-access modifiers, where are non-access modifiers used, what are identifiers and how to name them correctly.  

**Thoughts:** I skipped a day due to my Japanese study session. This should be day 6 ,but I just want to count the days I learn upto 100. Now, I have known access modifiers and non-access modifiers clearly.

### Day 6: June 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I learn what are data types, how does stack memory and reference memory works(not in details), what are primitive data types and which ones can be used as literal. 

**Thoughts:** I'm quite sleepy and distract my thoughts frequently ,and it's quite challenging to learn java today.

### Day 7: June 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I learn what is primitive casting, what is reference data type, how does jvm work and how does garbage collection work.

**Thoughts:** I really don't understand well and can't get into it since it's saying how memory works when we write class and objects.

### Day 8: June 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learn What and how multi-references work, how does static variable and instance variable passes in a static method, What is the difference between Primitive and References and What are primitive wrappers and wrapper classes.

**Thoughts:** I start studying later than the usual time. Today biggest harvest is I clearly understand differences between primitive and references and how does a static method's arguments work depending on variable types.

### Day 9: June 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learn what are operators and how to use them and what is expression.

**Thoughts:** Today, I don't write many codes and mainly take important nodes that I haven't known.

### Day 10: June 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learn what and how to use decision statement, what is for statement and what is switch statement 

**Thoughts:** I get distract and scatter my thought a lot today ,and I finish it later than usual.

### Day 11: June 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learn what is while statements, what is nested loop, what is branching statement and what is label in branching statement.

**Thoughts:** Today, I study later than usual time. I've finished lesson 1 (Language Fundamental of Java).

### Day 12: June 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learn what is OOP, what are OO concept in Java, what is encapsulation and how to make well encapsulation class.

**Thoughts:** There is still unclear parts about well encapsulation ,but I have grasped concept of well encapsulation. So, it won't be difficult to learn forward.

### Day 13: June 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learn what is inheritance, what is type casting, what is constructing child and what is overriding methods.

**Thoughts:** I skipped challenge for one day since my computer got caught in trojan. It troubled me so much. Lately, I feel coffee can't keep me all night. I even fell asleep at 1am and wake up 5 am while I was studying. Nevertheless, I need new plan for study if coffee can't keep me up all night.

### Day 14: June 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learn what is overriding method and how to override a method, what is abstraction, what is abstract class and what is abstract method.

**Thoughts:** Abstraction is pretty deep. I need more study time to fully comprehend it.
