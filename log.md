# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I learn how to write class in java, how to comment, what is variable, what is code block, how to differentiate global variables and local variables, what are the differences between instance and static variables, how to create an object.

**Thoughts:** I have now know differences instance and static variables and how to use them correctly.
